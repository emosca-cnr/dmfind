#' Interactome derived from STRING db v12.0
#' igraph object with 17288 genes and 174962 interactions. Only interactions with confidence >=700 and the top 3 interactions with confidence >=400 & < 700 were considered. Confidence score was calculated without textmining, as described at the URL https://string-db.org). Original protein identifiers were mapped to Entrez Gene identifiers using mappings from NCBI Entrez (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov dowload date 2023-09-19) and https://string-db.org
